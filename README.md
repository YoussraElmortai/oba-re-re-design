# OBA re-re-design
## re-visting an old project I did during my studies
### The goal
During my studies, we had the chance to work with the OBA (the public library in Amsterdam). They wanted to redesign some functionalities on their website.
It was important to keep in mind that the Public Library of Amsterdam is more than just a libraryâ€”it is a community center. People can come for financial advice, help with the Dutch language, and students can reserve study spots.
This consideration was crucial because the functionalities should be accessible to everyone.
